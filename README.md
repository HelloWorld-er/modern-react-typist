# modern-react-typist

This is a modern React component for typing effect. It is a simple and easy-to-use component that allows you to create a
typing effect for any text. The component is built using React and TypeScript.

The component allows you to nest other components inside it, and it will automatically handle the typing effect for them. This makes it easy to create complex typing effects with minimal effort.

## Installation
You can install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install modern-react-typist
```

## Typist Component
It currently has several props that you can use to customize the typing effect:
- `children`: The text to be typed. This can be anything that can be seen as a ReactNode(s), including other components.
- `delay`: The speed of the typing effect in milliseconds. The default value is 100.
- `cursor`: The cursor to be used. There is no a default cursor element.
